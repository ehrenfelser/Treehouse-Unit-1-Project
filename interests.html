<h3>Learn more about me</h3>
<p>During my day to day, I love to cook! I am to try new recipes al the time and I love to collect cookbooks.  Some of my favourite dishes to make are Pho, curries and soups. My favourite style of food is anything spicy. If you need a good wine recommendation for spicy, it would be a sweeter-style wine like Gew√ºrztraminer or Riesling. Luckily, food and wine go hand in hand. I have a great appreciation for food and wine pairings. Most of my friends, who are not in the wine industry, phone me all the time to recommend wine for their dinners. My family also loves cooking and wine pairings and we have fabulous dinners all the time. </p>
<p>I am so excited to start travelling again. During March of 2020, my sister and I had this amazing trip to Hawaii planned and one week before we were about to take flight, we had to cancel the trip. But now that the borders are slowly opening up, we still plan to make it out there one day. One of my favourite ways to travel is by car. I am road trip junkie. I have yet to see the East coast of Canada and am planning to do a cross Canada road trip. While on road trips, you do need good music though! The styles of music I listen to most is hip-hop and rock.  I like a wide range of artists from Kendrick Lamar to The Blue Stones. I am so grateful for Spotify to be able to save all my music on one platform!</p>
