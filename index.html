        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am excited to be starting my new journey as a Front End Developer! Before my interest into coding, I was in the British Columbia wine industry.  I spent the last 6 years studying Canadian and international wines, all while managing a wine bar/music venue and a sales agent for multiple small lot wineries. </p>
        <p>As someone who is new to tech and coding, this will be a ambitious new career for myself but I am up for the challenge!</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I am looking foward to learn more about the following:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>Because of the pandemic, I was not able to continue with my positions and did have to look for work elsewhere. That is when I applied at Shopify and started my role as a Support Advisor in February. Within 6 months I was able to grow into a Shopify Plus Technical Support Specialist where I was introduced to our Front End Development team. I am working towards joining that team in the near future!</p>
